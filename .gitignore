# Docker specific files
# Since you're using docker-compose, you might want to ignore the
# automatically generated volume data if it's created outside of docker's management.
# But for typical setups, you only ignore things like build context and secret files.
# Temporarily ignoring the example below, only uncomment if needed:
# docker-compose.override.yml
# *.pem
# *.key
